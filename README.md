Analysis scripts for epigenome-wide association study of ASD status in MINERvA study (a subset of iPSYCH). These accompany the manuscript Elevated polygenic burden for autism is associated with differential DNA methylation at birth (under review).

In this repo there are scripts that demonstrate:

1. The QC of the DNA methylation data profiled with the Illumina 450K array.
2. The epigenome-wide association study of ASD cases vs controls.
3. The epigenome-wide association study of ASD polygenic risk score.
4. The co-localisation analysis between ASD and DNA methylaion using DNA methylation quantiative trait loci derived in this dataset.

Please note that for security reasons filepaths and identifiers have been removed, therefore this serve as a guide to the analysis.
